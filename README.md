一款来自《小猪佩奇》的子供向游戏  
An interesting game for kids. (from Peppa Pig)  
这是我的第一次还算完整的游戏开发。即使看起来毫无意义，实际上也的确毫无意义，游戏质量也一言难尽，整个项目几乎不合规范，但毕竟是第一次尝试，只是熟悉开发流程。今后我还会继续沿着游戏开发的这条路走下去，总有一天，我会让游戏这种艺术形式被所有人认可。  
It's my first complete game development. Even though it's meaningless, inferior and substandard, it is my first try. I only want to go through the development process. In the future, I will countinue programing to bring out the artistry of computer games.
